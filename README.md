Energias em Batalha (Energies at Battle) 🃏⚡

Is a strategic Card Combat Game (CCG) developed with Unity and C#. It challenges players to master energy management while learning about sustainability through a battle between "The Good" (eco-friendly actions) and "The Evil" (waste and pollution).


🎮 Gameplay & Mechanics

* Objective: Reduce the opponent's 50 HP to zero using a deck of 20 unique cards.

* Strategic Balance: "Good" cards have low costs and high defense, while "Evil" cards offer high attack but are unsustainable and expensive.

* Dynamic Energy System: Turn-based energy distribution (10 to 12 points) designed to balance the advantage between the first and second players.

* AI Difficulty Modes: Three battle arenas (Conscious Consumption, Green Energy, and Clean Energy) featuring Easy, Medium, and Hard AI logic.

* Automated Combat: A positional attack phase where cards damage opposing units or strike the enemy player directly if the lane is clear.


🚀 Technologies & Core Concepts

* Unity & C#: Core engine and programming logic.

* Scriptable Objects: Implemented for a scalable card database.

* Turn-Based Logic: Managed through complex game states including Draw, Action, and Attack phases.

* Deck Management: Custom systems for shuffling, drawing, and discard pile mechanics.

* Dynamic UI: Real-time responsive interface that tracks health, energy, and card stats.
